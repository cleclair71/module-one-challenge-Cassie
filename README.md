# Horiseon Module 1 Challenge

## Description

My aim is to update the starter code so that it meets accessibility standards and so that the website is better optimized for search engines.

In this starter code I added a variety of invisible features to help accessibility and SEO. Listed below are the features I added and the reason why I added them.
    * **title:** Titles define the document and is important for users and search engines to understand the webpages content before clicking on the link.
    * **tabindex:** I added a tabindex feature so that keyboard users could navigate the website with the tab button
    * **aria-label/aria-labelled:** I added as a a label for accessibility and SEO
    * **alt tags:** I added alt tags to images to improve accessibility by describing the images
    * **role:** I added role to make the website more facilitative and accessible
    * **id:** I added id to my HTML script so I could change it in CSS
    * **abbr:** I added abbr on SEO for accessibility
    * **strong:** I added strong to add keywords into my text for SEO
    * **comments:** I added comments in both my CSS sheet and HTML file to help navigate the features I was changing and organize the changes I made
    * **hover:** I used the pseudo-class hover to make the navigation links in the header more interactive
    * **sections:** I used sections to make my application easier for assistive technologies

## Installation

Once clicking on the website link, you may navigate through the page with the tab hot-key, by scrolling with your mouse pad or by clicking the links at the top of the page in the header in order to navigate to each topic.
